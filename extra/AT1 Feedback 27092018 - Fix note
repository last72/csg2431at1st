[     ] Note - The register link has an extra /php/ in it on some pages.

[its working] Guests can view member profiles, while only logged in users should be able to do this.
[FIXED] Registration is well done, but you don't need to get the password correct to log in - a valid username and any password gets you in.
[     ] Best to use consistent field types when registering and editing - the drop downs are replaced by text fields.
User management aspects are otherwise implemented and working well.

[     ] Average rating should be rounded to 1 decimal place, rather than the whole number.
[     ] Only storing the date of comments, rather than the date and time - making the display of discussion a little less orderable.
Rating/Discussion aspects are otherwise implemented and working well.

[     ] Can insert duplicate movies (same name and year), but movie adding and editing otherwise working well.
[     ] Deleting a movie does not delete the ratings and discussion for the movie.

Excellent work.
Good to see evidence of good communication, team work and time management!
Remember to include the readme info/references mentioned in the assignment brief.
